in this 10th, final folder of vidly application,
i added some codes to deploy app such as changing codes in config folder,
require('helmet') and require compression, and app.use()ing them, and 
a couple of other changes, so you dont need to add any codes more to deploy
this app.

PROBLEM: deployed to heroku but as for the db itself, mlab add on in heroku
was terminated so i needed to use mongodb cloud but it didnt work out,
so next time when you're creating a real project, you need to see the 
deployment section again!
