how to get started with jest?

- npm i jest --save-dev

- go to package.json

-  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },


>>> change that ^^^^ to >>>>


  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"            // now change to "jest --watchAll"
  },

  // ^^ NOTE: jest in above script is the CLI that comes with jest that we use to run our tests.
  // which means, in terminal when you > npm test, the jest CLI will run!
