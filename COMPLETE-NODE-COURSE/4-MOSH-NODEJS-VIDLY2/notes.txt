Information Expert Principle > 
if an object that has enough information, and is an expert at a given area, 
that object should be responsible for making decisions and performing tasks (like cooking
is done by chef, not waiter).

IN THIS CASE, THE USER OBJECT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING THE JWT TOKEN, 
no matter when registering a new user, or logging in a new user!
